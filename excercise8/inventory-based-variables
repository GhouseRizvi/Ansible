We have seen how to define variable in the playbook for understanding purpose
mostly variables are defined outside of the variable that is for reusability purpose.

#####################################################################################################
here we're agoing to define the variables

mkdir group_vars

crate the file inside that called all 

follow the same structure 

dbname: sky
dbuser: pilot
dbpass: aircraft

these are 3 variable we defined in the group_vars/all file 

so now if you run the ansible-playbook db.yaml it'll run with its local variable because its have a higher priority
  
#####################################################################################################

lets redirect the db.yaml to use the variable from group_var/all file 
open the db.yaml comment the local variable save it
now the variable it'll not find in the playbook 
so it'll go out and look for the variables  
wher will it look?
ansible has it structure "garoup_vars/all"
so it'll look for the variables in group_vars/all file and execute the module
